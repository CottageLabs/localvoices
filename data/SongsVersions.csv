The order of verses here is unusual: in contrast to the normal order, the verse where the daughter tells us she will die of grief (which is usually last) comes before the verse where the father offers to marry her to another man. One verse also implies that the young protagonist is killed by his own brother, though in the next verse it is clear that the murder was committed by the young woman's brother (as is the usual narrative). This is probably a simple mistake, the contributor singing ""his brother"" instead of ""her brother"".

The Twa Brothers,,"Fratricide ballad in which two brothers coming from school have a contest, during which one brother is killed.",,,LV005,,,LV005.002,Two Little Boys,,"Providing a back-story to this ballad, Stanley Robertson explains that a noblewoman's twin sons inherited her wealth, and were left in the care of their stepfather, who sent them away to study knighthood and to learn from monks, while planning to murder them for his late wife's wealth. 

The song begins as the two boys are coming home from school; one takes the low road by the burn [stream], the other the high road to the castle wall. The stepfather intercepts the boy on the low road, deceives him into thinking they are going fishing, and drowns him. The brother, from his high perch, sees what happens and vows revenge. He prepares a poisonous potion, which he puts it in his stepfather's food and wine, and refuses to summon a priest as he watches his stepfather die. The drowned brother is buried with their mother, and the stepfather in a separate grave.

Stanely learned the song from his mother, but does not know where she learned it. She believed the song to date from around the twelfth century, as the priests at the time were also doctors - this being one reason why the stepfather called for a priest when he fell ill. The song is sung to a tune that many consider to be Irish in origin, though Stanley was assured it was an old Scottish air.",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,ID075,Stanley,Robertson,Aberdeen,57.149717,-2.094278,,,,Barbara McDermitt,1979.10.11,School of Scottish Studies Sound Archive SA1979.141.A1,Aberdeen,57.149717,-2.094278,,,,,,,38,,49,,"7 verses of 4 lines.

This version is strikingly similar in places to Jeannie Robertson's 'Davie Faa', especially the mention of pease straw, but has an additional second stanza mentioning the noble lord, and further verses mentioning a payment of fifty guineas towards the nurse's fee, and a promise of another roll in the straw the next time the tinker returns.

The actual incident behind this song took place on 7th July 1640, when the Earl of Argyll, Archibald Campbell (1607-1661), destroyed Airlie Castle, belonging to James Ogilvie (1593-1666), the 1st Earl of Airlie. The two were on opposing sides of the conflict involving the National Covenant. Ogilvy had left with a force of men to aid Charles I, and the anti-royalist Campbell seized the opportunity to attack. Confusion surrounding the 'Charlie' referenced in the song has led to inclusions of verses linking the ballad with Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Jacobite conflict of 1745-46, including a last verse in which Cameron of Lochiel (an eminent Jacobite) swears revenge for the crime.

The actual incident behind this song took place on 7th July 1640, when the Earl of Argyll, Archibald Campbell (1607-1661), destroyed Airlie Castle, belonging to James Ogilvie (1593-1666), the 1st Earl of Airlie. The two were on opposing sides of the conflict involving the National Covenant. Ogilvy had left with a force of men to aid Charles I, and the anti-royalist Campbell seized the opportunity to attack. Confusion surrounding the 'Charlie' referenced in the song has led to inclusions of verses linking the ballad with Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Jacobite conflict of 1745-46, including a last verse in which Cameron of Lochiel (an eminent Jacobite) swears revenge for the crime.

The original of this song was composed by Charles Gray (1782-1851), of Anstruther-wester, Fife, and published by him in poetry collections, first in 1811, and again in 1841. In the decades that followed his death, the Dundee broadside seller, 'The Poet's Box', began printing the now famous song 'The Road to Dundee' (Roud Folk Song Index no. 2300), which is in part clearly derived from Gray's song.

Gray suggested the air 'Bonnie Dundee' ('Up wi' the Bonnets o Bonnie Dundee') for his song, which fits his 3 stanzas of 8 lines. All versions of 'The Road to Dundee' however are grouped into 4-line verses. At least one broadside suggests the air to the song 'Lucy's Flittin' (Roud 2641) by William Laidlaw (1780-1845) and James Hogg (1770-1835). The air originally suggested by the authors of 'Lucy's Flittin' was the tune 'Paddy O'Rafferty' but there is also a later setting by R. A. Smith (1779-1829); neither of these correspond to the later well-known popular melody for 'The Road to Dundee'.

This popular song has its origins in a poem called 'Grim Winter was Howling', composed by Charles Gray (1782-1851), of Anstruther-wester, Fife, and published by him in poetry collections, first in 1811, and again in 1841. In the decades that followed Gray's death, the Dundee broadside seller 'The Poets' Box' began printing 'The Road to Dundee' (Roud Folk Song Index no. 2300), which is in part clearly derived from Gray's song.

Gray suggested the air 'Bonnie Dundee' ('Up wi' the Bonnets o Bonnie Dundee') for his song, which fits his 3 stanzas of 8 lines. All versions of the 'Road to Dundee' however are grouped into 4-line verses, and at least one broadside suggests the air to the song 'Lucy's Flittin' (Roud 2641) by William Laidlaw (1780-1845) and James Hogg (1770-1835), which may have been either the authors' original suggestion of the tune 'Paddy O'Rafferty' or a later setting by R. A. Smith (1779-1829); neither of these correspond to the later well-known popular melody for 'The Road to Dundee'.

The events in this ballad involved John Gordon of Brackley, near Ballater, and John Farquharson of Inverey, beside Braemar, though the exact details are unknown. One account relates that in September 1666, John Gordon impounded some of Farquharson's cattle, and when the latter attempted to retrieve them, an altercation ensued, which ended in the death of the Baron of Brackley. Another account describes a similar end when Gordon tried to demand payment of a fine from Farquharson, and resorted to force, causing Farquharson to retaliate in self-defence.

Etnach is just off the Water of Tanar in Glen Tanar about six miles south-east of Ballater.

John MacDonald learned this around forty-one years before from the singing of an old shepherd by the name of MacGregor.

This song refers to the Battle of Cromdale (1690), in reality a significant Jacobite defeat, but which this traditional song usually describes as a resounding victory. In Mr MacDonald's short version however, the complete omission of several verses, in which James Graham, Marquess of Montrose turns the tide of battle, leaves a narrative much closer to the actual events.

Willie Scott learned this song from the singing of Willie Mitchell of Campbeltown [Person ID: 2175] when the two met at Blairgowrie Folk Festival in 1968; Willie Scott later put his own melody to the song. Willie Mitchell had obtained his version from a Mr. Reid, farmer at Callieburn; the MacShannons of Machrihanish [Person IDs: 2162/2165/4878] also had a shorter version of the song.

In 'Tocher' 25 (1977, pp. 36-37), Hamish Henderson writes: ""The small farming community of Callieburn is in the hills a few miles north of Campbeltown and the song tells of emigration from an area that suffered hardship in the 1830s and 1840s - especially during the 'hungry 40s' when the West Highlands had a famine almost as severe as Ireland's."" Henderson says that Willie Mitchell of Campbeltown (a friend of the contributor here, Alec MacShannon) collected a longer version of the song from a ""Mr. Reid ... the farmer at Callieburn"". (Callieburn is now usually spelled Calliburn.)

This song was famously learned by the border shepherd, Willie Scott, from Willie Mitchell, at a late-night ceilidh in the Angus Hotel during the 1968 TMSA Blairgowrie festival; the events are detailed by Hamish Henderson in 'Alias MacAlias' (1992, pp. 95-96).
